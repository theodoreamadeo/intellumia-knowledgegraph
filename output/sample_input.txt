Around the world , basketball has become a favorite sport for many. From the streets of London to the mountains of China , people practice slam dunks. From the city parks of New York to the plains of Africa , people dream of making a winning shot.

Even if you have never played or watched a basketball game , you may have some idea of what it ' s about. You need teams , a ball , and hoops that hang high on each side. Players dribble the ball across a court that is rectangular . You make points by getting the ball through the hoop.

Title: Slam Dunk: The Story of Basketball

If you ever visit the Basketball Hall of Fame in Massachusetts , you will find the name James Naismith written almost everywhere. James Naismith is the man who invented basketball. In his honor , the hall is known as the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame .

James A. Naismith was born in a small town in Canada on November 6 , 1861. As a child , Naismith loved sports. He won many medals for gymnastics . When he started college , Naismith studied everything about sports. He also played on the football team.

In 1891 , Naismith began working as a teacher in Springfield , Massachusetts. Massachusetts had very cold winters. The students could not play outside , so Naismith was given a job. He had only 14 days to think of a sport to play indoors. The school was also small , so Naismith needed to come up with a game that didn ' t need a lot of space. He also wanted the game to be fun for students.

Naismith thought about the kinds of games he played as a kid. Soon , he came up with a game that would use a soccer ball and two empty peach baskets. The baskets would hang on a wall. Students would make points if they got the ball into the baskets. Naismith wrote 13 rules for the game. He taught his students how to play. They loved it! Soon other students came to watch them play.

## THE GAME

<!-- image -->

The first real basketball game was held on January 20 , 1892 , in Springfield , Massachusetts. The game had two teams and 18 players. There were nine players on each team. Since it was the first game , everyone was new at it. The game did not go on for long.

It lasted only 30 minutes. The final score was 1-0. Everyone loved watching the players try to get the ball into the peach basket. After the game was over , they could not think of a better name for this sport than ' basket-ball. ' The first basketball games were held in cities such as New York , Philadelphia , and Boston. Sometimes , teams would travel far to play another team. On November 7 , 1896 , two states played against each other for the first time. The game was between New Jersey ' s

Trenton team and New York ' s Brooklyn team. Trenton won with a score of 15-1 in the first-ever state-to-state basketball game. The ticket price for even the best seats was only $2 each. In those days , most players were paid only $15. That year , Fred Cooper became the first highest-paid player when he made $16.

When Naismith was first asked to make a game for his class , he probably never thought others would someday play his game outside of his school. Over time , a game that started out with a fruit basket on a wall would become one of the most-loved sports in history.

Soon basketball began spreading to many other countries. More people wanted to watch it and play it. By 1936 , basketball became one of the games at the Berlin Olympics . That must have been a very proud moment for this inventor!

Naismith died in 1939 , but will always be remembered. In 1959 , his name was placed into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Thanks to Naismith ' s invention , basketball has grown into one of the world ' s most popular sports. There are even special postage stamps made in his honor. In fact , the National Basketball Association still uses many of Naismith ' s basketball rules.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a group that watches over basketball games in the United States. There are 30 teams in the NBA today. Though some things , like team size , are still the same , a lot about the game has changed.

Players do not use soccer balls or peach baskets. Instead , there are special balls and hoops with strong nets that players use on the court. Basketball uniforms have also changed. They look different from what the first team wore. Each team represents a different city , and has its own special logo.
